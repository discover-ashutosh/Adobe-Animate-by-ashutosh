SYMBOLS
- The software is treating every set of New keyframes as New symbol
    ~ And in the Practise dog Project, I realized somehow I have copied the the first symbol onto other symbol.
- Do NOT create new objects down the timeline after pressing F7
    Because software will perceive both the objects as two different objects which are (truly for you the same 
    objects.)..........12th Nov 22
- Do delete a symbol 
    You will have to first break every instance of symbol on entire timeline, and then delete it from library.
    - Wheras, if you were to delete it from the library only, then there will be problems that we haven't figured out
    how to resolve yet.
